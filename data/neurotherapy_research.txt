=== MECHANISM OF ACTION ===

Study: "Neural Mechanisms of Frequency Entrainment" (Neuroscience Institute, 2024)
Biological Mechanisms:
1. Brainwave Synchronization: External frequencies entrain neural oscillations
2. Neurotransmitter Modulation: Specific frequencies trigger dopamine, serotonin release
3. Default Mode Network Regulation: Alpha/theta frequencies modulate DMN activity
4. Autonomic Nervous System Balance: Frequencies influence sympathetic/parasympathetic balance
5. Neuroplasticity Enhancement: Repeated entrainment strengthens neural pathways
6. Glymphatic System Activation: Delta frequencies enhance brain detoxification
