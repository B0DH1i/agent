4. Neurotransmitter Modulation: Specific frequencies trigger release of healing chemicals
5. DNA Resonance: Certain frequencies may influence genetic expression
6. Quantum Field Effects: Frequencies may interact with biofield energy systems

Therapeutic Mechanisms:
1. Stress Reduction: Lower frequencies activate parasympathetic nervous system
2. Emotional Release: Mid-range frequencies facilitate emotional processing
3. Cognitive Enhancement: Higher frequencies stimulate mental clarity and focus
4. Spiritual Connection: Ultra-high frequencies may enhance consciousness
5. Physical Healing: Specific frequencies promote cellular repair and regeneration
6. Energy Balancing: Harmonic frequencies restore energetic equilibrium
