BINAURAL BEATS RESEARCH DATABASE
Comprehensive Clinical Studies on Binaural Beat Therapy for Emotional and Cognitive Enhancement

=== FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH ===

Historical Background:
Binaural beats were first discovered by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove in 1839. The phenomenon occurs when two slightly different frequencies are presented to each ear, creating a perceived third frequency equal to the mathematical difference between the two tones.

Study: "Neurophysiology of Binaural Beat Perception" (Oster, 1973 - Updated Analysis 2023)
Journal: Scientific American, Neuroscience Update
Key Findings:
- Binaural beats are processed in the superior olivary complex of the brainstem
- The phenomenon requires intact hearing in both ears
- Beat frequencies below 30 Hz are most effective for brainwave entrainment
- Individual differences in beat perception correlate with baseline EEG patterns
